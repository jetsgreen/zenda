Book List (ES6)

### Overview
In this application you can add books by inputing the title, author and ISBN code.  After you can delete them from the UI by hitting the
X button.  The application has several validations and alerts to make sure we get confirmation when the user fires an event.  I utilized
HTML5, BootsWatch for stlying and Javascript.  I used ES6 classes to code the application.  I set up local storage so the user can save books to and delete them as well. When the users comes back to the app, his/her local storage will keep track of their use of the app.

### Technologies:
